// CONDITION 
// You can create your own array of numbers but consider trying this problem with a few different sets to verify your solution.

If you're feeling comfortable with this, try the slightly more challenging bonus challenge below.
// Bonus intermediate challenge: Create a function that can return the sum of a particular column or row number in a table.
